## 硬件徽章

每个持有有效超级会议入场券的人都将获得一个令人惊叹的徽章！这里显示的是一个原型，生产徽章将有黑色而不是红色的阻焊膜。对于 Supercon 来说，全新的是硬件黑客附加板，它将带有所有徽章，便于添加您的定制电路。

 [![Supercon Badge Prototype (production version will be black)](img/fad0228d9970a3c3755a8b58ad889eeb.png "hackaday-superconference-prototype-badge")](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/08/everything-supercon-this-is-big/hackaday-superconference-prototype-badge/) Supercon Badge Prototype (production version will be black) [![Hackaday Belgrade badge with hardware breakout prototype (production will be black)](img/27c23da088712c069faa44e9bec49acd.png "hackaday-belgrade-badge-with-hardware-breakout")](https://hackaday.com/2018/10/08/everything-supercon-this-is-big/hackaday-belgrade-badge-with-hardware-breakout/) Hackaday Belgrade badge with hardware breakout prototype (production will be black)

这是基本徽章的最新版本。它有一个完整的 QWERTY 键盘，漂亮的彩色屏幕，和一个带 3 语音音频的扬声器。有一个解释器和编辑器，这样你就可以用 BASIC 编程语言编写自己的程序，并存储 16 个最大 16 kb 的程序。它运行 CP/M，所以你可以在上面玩 Zork(默认加载)或者使用串行转 USB 来加载你自己的程序。这只是冰山一角，这个设计(Voja Antonic:硬件，Jaromir Sukuba:软件)在 5 月的贝尔格莱德 Hackaday 大会上大受欢迎。前往[项目页面](https://hackaday.io/project/80627-badge-for-hackaday-conference-2018-in-belgrade)，尽可能多地学习，为为期一周的徽章黑客活动做准备！更多信息即将发布。

我们知道你想得到一个，我们已经有很多人问，如果他们买了票，我们是否会给他们邮寄一个。不幸的是，不行。你需要[出现在 super co](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hackaday-superconference-2018-tickets-47386813234?aff=1008com)上。我们很高兴收到 Microchip 捐赠的芯片(运行 PIC32 ),部分组装成本由 Macrofab 捐赠。所有零件都在手边(30，000 个开关！)并且生产运行即将开始。如果我们不知何故超支了，我们会在 Tindie 上出售任何额外的票…但就票的情况来看，我们不能做出任何承诺。

## 吃饱喝足

令人惊讶的人，引人入胜的谈话，酷的研讨会，和令人瞠目结舌的硬件徽章…你唯一需要的是一个饱满的肚子，我们有这些。Supercon 的食物既美味又丰富，而且已经包含在门票里了。饮料也是。

星期五，我们将为晚上的开球晚会准备小吃和饮料。周六周日早点来吃早餐。这两天都会提供午餐。周六是一个大型派对，有茶点庆祝 2018 年 Hackaday 奖的结束，周日甚至还有一个非官方的派对。

Supercon 是一种体验，是帕萨迪纳市中心的一小片黑客天堂。

## Hackaday 派对

让我们面对现实吧，整个周末感觉就像一个派对。但是随着每天的谈话和研讨会的结束，我们将转变为真正的派对模式。周五和周六，我们将现场直播 Rich Hogben 和 DJ Jackalope 等 Hackaday 最爱的节目。互动黑客，演示和游戏将在手边。徽章黑客攻击当然会继续，我们确信自发的黑客攻击会成真(在下面的评论中询问去年的与会者)。

这是你的会议。Hackaday 社区充满了不可思议的人，Supercon 的氛围庆祝每个人朝圣到这个终极硬件大会的这一方面。错过这个就是错过了真正独特和真正特别的东西。我们迫不及待地想在 11 月见到大家！
