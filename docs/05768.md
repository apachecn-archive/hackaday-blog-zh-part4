LoRa is the go-to tech for low power, long range wireless sensor networks. Designing with off-the-shelf modules can be a boon or a bane depending on the documentation and support. Luckily, [Renzo] has [prepared a set of tutorials](https://www.mischianti.org/category/my-libraries/lora-e32-devices/) to get you started.In his seven part series of write-ups, [Renzo] starts by connecting the E32 module from AliExpress to an Arduino as well as an ESP8266 to demonstrate essential communications. Then he discusses the configuration options and the library he created to make like a bit easier. Following that is a series of posts discussing transmission types as well as power saving methods including sleep modes and wake-on-radio.The information will be extremely handy for someone starting off with the SX1276/SX1278 Wireless Modules which are relatively inexpensive as opposed to more standardized development kits. We love the abundance of fritzing diagrams, arduino code and helper library and hope someone will build on it. You can [get the library from Github](https://github.com/xreef/LoRa_E32_Series_Library) for your tinkering pleasure.If you are looking for ideas for this newly discovered skill, have a look at [LoRa Enabled Mailbox](https://hackaday.com/2020/02/15/aaa-powered-lora-mailbox-sensor-goes-the-distance/) as well as [Electric Fence Monitoring with The Things Network](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/28/monitoring-an-electric-fence-with-lorawan/) for a bit of IoT action.
