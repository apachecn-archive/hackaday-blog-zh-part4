Once again, [Dan Bostian] is ahead of the curve when it comes to bringing bunches of banana puns to the table, but we think you’ll find [this banana split macropad](https://github.com/dbostian/bananasplit) quite appealing nonetheless. Does this tasty thing look familiar? It ought to — we discovered, plucked, and uncovered [the one-piece version](https://hackaday.com/2021/05/14/go-ape-with-a-banana-macropad/) last summer, and this time, [Dan] simply made our two-piece, wireless dreams come true.Peel back the — oh, forget it. Inside, you’ll find a nice!nano running the show from the right-hand board using ZMK firmware, and a banana-shaped chalk outline on the left-hand silkscreen that represents how completely [Dan] killed it with this build. You can use any switches you want, as long as they’re Cherry MX-compatible in the ~~shoe~~ footprint department.The PCBs are open source, of course, and so are the printed parts — [it’s all there in the repo](https://github.com/dbostian/bananasplit). As for the stickers, well, you’ll have to produce those yourself.via [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/12/banana-split-macropad-adafruit-johnedgarpark-adafruit/)
